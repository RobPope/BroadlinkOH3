## Discovery

Devices in the above list that are set up and working in the Broadlink mobile app should be discoverable by initiating a discovery from the OpenHAB UI. 

> The `Lock Device` setting must be switched off for your device via the Broadlink app to be discoverable in openHAB.

## Map File

The Broadlink RM family of devices can transmit IR codes.
The map file contains a list of IR command codes to send via the device.
The file uses the *Map Transformation* and is stored in the `<OPENHAB_CONF>/transform` folder.
By default, the file name is `broadlink.map` but can be changed using the `mapFile` setting.

Here is a map file example:

```
TV_POWER=26008c0092961039103a1039101510151014101510151039103a10391015101411141015101510141139101510141114101510151014103a10141139103911391037123a10391000060092961039103911391014111410151015101411391039103a101411141015101510141015103911141015101510141015101510391015103911391039103a1039103911000d05000000000000000000000000
heatpump_off=2600760069380D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D0C0D290D0C0D290D290D290D290D290D290E0002900000

```

The above codes are power on/off for Samsung TVs and Power Off for a Fujitsu heat pump.
To send either code, the string `TV_POWER` or `heatpump_off` must be sent to the `command` channel for the device.
